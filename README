This is my project for the Ludum Dare game jam #48. Tentatively titled "In the Hole." It is a Godot 2D project. 

I pity all who tread 'deeper and deeper' down this rabit hole...

Collision layers:
1. tunnel placement - buildings block, resources don't
2. resources - buildings can use them, but tunnels need to be built on top
4. enemy senses - need to be able to see buildings, but not interfer with placement or see a building's sensing circle.
